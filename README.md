# Java-Project
My final project for Introduction to Java Class: A Library program where users can check out books and see what books are available. GUI is written using JFrame.

Book.java: keeps track of the title and type of books (text books, novel, magazines)
Library.java: keeps an array of books. Let users check out books, display the number of textbook/novel/magazines available
LibraryGUI.java: is the user interface.
Project.java: is the main class. Displays Library GUI.
